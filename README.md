Is ChatGPT tripping or is life a trip.

This code was lliterally created by ChatGPT by feeding it in my src/qudit.py code from my 'py-qregister' repo.

Let jesus take the wheel. I dont know what this code does but it sounds cool and someone smarter than me should do the actual thing. It was a synthesis of the research ive been doing on quantum logic units with cellular automata. Shoutout John Conway, Stephen Wolfram and Roger Penrose. Hope this helps someone.

Run from root: python src/main.py

TODO: Automata does not work as desired; but this code does look cool right?
